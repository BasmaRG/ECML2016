# Measuring-the-Stability-of-Feature-Selection
Matlab code of the experiemnts in the paper "Measuring the Stability of Feature Selection" by Sarah Nogueira and Gavin Brown (University of Manchester) submitted to ECML 2016.

Pick-up a degree of redundancy rho between the relevant feature between 0 and 1 and then on command window of Matlab:
>>main(rho);
will reproduce the experiments in the paper for the degree of redundancy specified.
